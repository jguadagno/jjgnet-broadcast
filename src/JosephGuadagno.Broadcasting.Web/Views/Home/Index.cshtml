        This site automates the broadcasting of blog posts, conferences, and streams. The goal behind the project is to provide a way to *broadcast* out information from one or more sources (collectors) and send them to other sources (publishers).
        This is not a data synchronization framework, but a replacement for services like Hoot Suite, IFTTT, etc.
        Currently, the function can monitor an RSS Feed and a YouTube playlist for new content.
        Once new content is found, it will send information about Twitter and Facebook.
        In other words, once I create a new blog post, this project will tweet about it and post it to my Facebook wall.
    </p>
    <h2>Plans</h2>
    <p>
        The next thing I want to add is the ability to store my upcoming speaking engagements, whether they be at a conference or the stream. This site will have a way to '<em>schedule</em>' notifications/social broadcasting of the events.
    </p>
    <p>
        Say I am speaking a conference in one month, I will be able to announce '<em>Hey, I'm speaking at ..., Details at:...</em>', I could schedule broadcast in 2 weeks, '<em>Sign up for my talk at ...</em>', then 30 minutes before the talk '<em>I'm up next in room ..., come watch</em>', then after the talk '<em>Hey, the content for my talk is available at ...</em>'
    </p>
