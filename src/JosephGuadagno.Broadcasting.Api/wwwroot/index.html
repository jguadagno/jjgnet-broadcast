<h1>This is the API for the JosephGuadagno.NET Broadcasting site.</h1>
<p>Automate the broadcasting of blog posts, conferences, and streams.</p>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
    This site automates the broadcasting of blog posts, conferences, and streams. The goal behind the project is to
    provide a way to *broadcast* out information from one or more sources (collectors) and send them to other sources
    (publishers).
    This is not a data synchronization framework, but a replacement for services like Hoot Suite, IFTTT, etc.
    Currently, the function can monitor an RSS Feed and a YouTube playlist for new content.
    Once new content is found, it will send information about Twitter and Facebook.
    In other words, once I create a new blog post, this project will tweet about it and post it to my Facebook wall.
</p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>
    The next thing I want to add is the ability to store my upcoming speaking engagements, whether they be at a
    conference or the stream. This site will have a way to '<em>schedule</em>' notifications/social broadcasting of the
    events.
</p>
<p>
    Say I am speaking a conference in one month, I will be able to announce '<em>Hey, I'm speaking at ..., Details
    at:...</em>', I could schedule broadcast in 2 weeks, '<em>Sign up for my talk at ...</em>', then 30 minutes before
    the talk '<em>I'm up next in room ..., come watch</em>', then after the talk '<em>Hey, the content for my talk is
    available at ...</em>'
