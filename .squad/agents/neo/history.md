# Neo — History

## Core Context

**Role:** Lead Reviewer & Architect  
**Specialty:** Architecture, code reviews, issue triage, sprint planning, patterns, CI/CD  
**Key Responsibilities:**
- Pull request review authority (architecture, security, patterns)
- Issue decomposition and squad assignment
- Pattern establishment and enforcement
- Sprint planning and closure

**Established patterns:**
- DTO/API: request DTOs exclude route params, return Task<ActionResult<T>>, null guard before ToResponse
- Pagination: guard divide-by-zero, clamp page≥1, pageSize 1–100
- Database: SaveChangesAsync override covers both variants
- Testing: sealed types use typed null, never Mock.Of<SealedType>()
- PR review: always verify diff against body, check issue status before review
- Authorization: GET form actions must match POST action auth level (fail-fast UX)
- Email queue: `AddMessageWithBase64EncodingAsync` (not plain `AddMessageAsync`) — Azure Functions queue triggers expect Base64
- Manager pattern: if a manager is a pure thin delegator with no logging, omit ILogger entirely to avoid CS0414 warning

**Active issues:** #608 (email notifications), #613 (auth UX fix), RBAC Phase 1/2

**Backlog:** 32 issues triaged across 6 squads. Sprint 11 closure complete.

## Recent Work

### 2026-04-05: Infrastructure Issues Triage — #635 and #636

**Issues triaged:**
- #635: Add health checks for Api, Web applications
- #636: Setup alerting for repeated exceptions in Application Insights

**Triage outcomes:**

**Issue #635 (Health Checks):**
- **Current state:** Basic `/health` and `/alive` endpoints exist via ServiceDefaults, but only have a "self" check (always healthy)
- **Gap:** No service-specific health checks for SQL Server, Azure Storage, Key Vault, Communication Services
- **Scope:** Add AspNetCore.HealthChecks.* NuGet packages, configure dependency health checks in ServiceDefaults
- **Level of effort:** Small (2 story points, 2-3 hours)
- **Routing:** `squad:sparks` (DevOps/Infrastructure)
- **Key finding:** Infrastructure already in place — just need to add dependency-specific checks

**Issue #636 (Exception Alerting):**
- **Current state:** Comprehensive telemetry via Application Insights + OpenTelemetry + Serilog, but NO alerting configured
- **Gap:** No Azure Monitor Alert Rules, Action Groups, or Smart Detection routing
- **Scope:** Create Action Group + Alert Rules for repeated exceptions (>5 in 15 min threshold)
- **Decision point:** Bicep IaC (recommended, 3 story points) vs. Portal-only (fast-track, 1-2 hours)
- **Level of effort:** Medium (3 story points if using Bicep, ~4-6 hours)
- **Routing:** `squad:sparks` primary, `squad:neo` for Bicep review
- **Blocked on:** Joseph's decision on IaC approach and notification recipients

**Actions taken:**
- Posted comprehensive triage comments to both issues on GitHub
- Applied `squad:sparks` labels to both issues
- Identified 5 open questions for #636 requiring Joseph's input

**Learnings:**
- ServiceDefaults project is the central location for cross-cutting concerns (health checks, telemetry, observability)
- Health check endpoints automatically exclude from OpenTelemetry tracing to reduce noise
- No IaC exists for Azure infrastructure — all resources manually provisioned (opportunity for improvement)
- Serilog multi-sink pattern: Console + File + Azure Table Storage + OpenTelemetry
- GlobalExceptionHandler in Api logs all unhandled exceptions with full context

**UPDATE (2026-04-05): Issue #636 Finalized**

Joseph answered all 5 blocking questions:
1. **Notification recipients:** Email
2. **Alert threshold:** >5 exceptions in 15 minutes (Neo's recommendation accepted)
3. **Exception filtering:** Yes — exclude ValidationException, NotFoundException, and similar non-critical exceptions
4. **IaC approach:** **BOTH** — Create Bicep templates AND Portal step-by-step instructions
5. **Environments:** Production only (staging no longer exists)

**Additional decision:** Joseph wants a separate issue created for "Bicep scripts for the whole environment" — he eventually wants all Azure infrastructure as IaC.

**Actions taken:**
- Posted finalized implementation spec to issue #636 (complete, actionable)
- Updated label from `squad:sparks` to `squad:cypher` (Bicep/IaC work belongs to Cypher)
- Created **new issue #637**: "Create Bicep scripts for the entire Azure environment (Infrastructure as Code)" — epic-level initiative
- Posted triage comment on #637 with phased approach (Phase 0 = #636, then App Insights, Storage, Key Vault, SQL, App Services, Functions, etc.)
- Applied `squad:cypher` label to #637

**Key decisions recorded:**
- Alert threshold: >5 exceptions in 15 minutes (production only)
- Notification: email
- Exception filters: yes (exclude ValidationException, NotFoundException)
- IaC approach: Bicep, modular, incremental by resource type
- Environments: production only (staging decommissioned)
- Broader IaC initiative: build incrementally, issue-by-issue (not big-bang)

**New issue:** #637 — Bicep IaC for entire Azure environment (8 story points, multi-sprint epic)

**Status:** ✅ All decisions recorded and posted to GitHub. Issue #637 created and triaged. Ready for Cypher to implement #636.

### 2026-04-05: Email Managers — PR #623 Review (Issue #617)

**PR:** #623 — `feat: EmailSender and EmailTemplateManager for #608 email notification system`
**Branch:** `issue-617`
**Author:** Trinity
**Verdict: ⚠️ APPROVED WITH NOTES**

**What was built:** `EmailSender` (partial class + `.logger.cs`), `EmailTemplateManager`, all 3 `ISettings` extended with `IEmailSettings`, DI registration across Api/Web/Functions, AppHost wiring.

**Findings:**
- ✅ All core patterns correct: Base64 via `AddMessageWithBase64EncodingAsync`, queue constant used, `[LoggerMessage]` pattern, DI scoping, AppHost `WithReference`
- ⚠️ `EmailTemplateManager._logger` injected but never used → CS0414 warning. Recommend removing the logger or adding logging calls.
- ⚠️ `EmailTemplateManager` uses old-style constructor (not primary), inconsistent with `EmailSender`. Not a blocker.
- ⚠️ `AzureCommunicationsConnectionString` in settings unused by this PR — forward-looking for #618.

**Inbox:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/neo-617-review.md`

### 2026-04-02: RBAC Phase 2 — Pre-PR Code Review (Issue #607)

**Branch:** `squad/rbac-phase2`
**Scope:** Role management UI, ownership-based delete, CreatedByEntraOid flow end-to-end
**Test count:** 96 — all passing

**Verdict: REQUEST CHANGES — 2 critical issues must be fixed before merge.**

---

#### 🔴 Critical Issues (Block Merge)

**1. OID claim type inconsistency — security bypass on pre-Phase-2 records**

All three content controllers (`EngagementsController`, `SchedulesController`, `TalksController`) use `User.FindFirstValue("oid")` (short JWT claim name) for the ownership check. The project's own constant `ApplicationClaimTypes.EntraObjectId` is `"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier"` (URI form). The `AdminController` uses this constant correctly.

- If the JWT middleware maps `oid` → URI form (standard .NET behavior), `currentUserOid` is `null` at runtime.
- When `currentUserOid == null` AND `record.CreatedByEntraOid == null` (all pre-Phase-2 records): `null != null` evaluates to `false` → `Forbid()` is **never called** → any Contributor can delete **all legacy records**.
- When `currentUserOid == null` AND record has a real OID: `null != "some-oid"` is `true` → Forbid() always fires → Contributor can **never** delete their own new records.

Fix required: Replace `User.FindFirstValue("oid")` with `User.FindFirstValue(ApplicationClaimTypes.EntraObjectId)` in all three controllers. Also add an explicit null guard: if `currentUserOid` is null or `record.CreatedByEntraOid` is null, return `Forbid()`.

Files: `EngagementsController.cs:139,200`, `SchedulesController.cs:161,196`, `TalksController.cs:109,151`

**2. TalksController.Delete performs deletion on HTTP GET — no CSRF protection, no confirmation**

`TalksController.Delete` is decorated `[HttpGet]` and immediately executes `DeleteEngagementTalkAsync`. Both `EngagementsController` and `SchedulesController` correctly use `[HttpGet]` for the confirmation view and `[HttpPost][ValidateAntiForgeryToken][ActionName("Delete")]` for `DeleteConfirmed`. `TalksController` skips this entirely — a crafted GET link on any page can silently delete a talk without user confirmation or CSRF token.

Fix required: Separate into GET (confirmation view) + POST `DeleteConfirmed` with `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`, matching the pattern of the other controllers.

File: `TalksController.cs:96–125`

---

#### 🟡 Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

**3. Tests use short `"oid"` claim form; AdminControllerTests uses URI form** — inconsistency means ownership tests pass in a way that may not reflect production behavior. After the critical fix above, tests should also be updated to use `ApplicationClaimTypes.EntraObjectId` for the `"oid"` claims.

**4. EF entity vs Domain nullable inconsistency (pre-flagged)** — `Data.Sql/Models/*.cs` use `string` (non-nullable, `#nullable disable`) while Domain models use `string?`. The DB column IS nullable. EF Core honors `#nullable disable` so this works at runtime, but creates misleading type signals for developers.

**5. ManageRolesViewModel leaks Domain model** — `CurrentRoles` and `AvailableRoles` are `IList<Role>` where `Role` is from `Broadcasting.Domain.Models`. Web layer convention is to use ViewModels throughout; a `RoleViewModel` should be introduced.

**6. No self-demotion guard in RemoveRole** — an Administrator can inadvertently remove their own Administrator role with no confirmation or prevention. CSRF is protected by `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`, but no business-rule guard exists.

**7. GetCalendarEvents() now requires auth (pre-flagged)** — class-level `[Authorize(RequireContributor)]` on `EngagementsController` gates this endpoint. If any public calendar widget or unauthenticated consumer called this endpoint pre-Phase-2, it will silently break.

**8. Add endpoints don't null-guard OID** — If `FindFirstValue(...)` returns null, `CreatedByEntraOid` is silently stored as null, making the record immediately un-deletable by Contributors. Should log a warning or fail fast.

---

#### 💡 Suggestions for Future Work

- **Centralize ownership checks** into a resource-based `IAuthorizationHandler<ContentOwnershipRequirement>` rather than repeating the pattern in each controller.
- **Introduce `RoleViewModel`** to keep the Web project's dependency graph clean.
- **Add migration idempotency test** — wire the SQL migration file into the CI pipeline's integration test run to catch regressions.
- **Phase 2.5 backfill** (already noted in migration SQL) — once historical data is available, backfill `CreatedByEntraOid` on existing records so Contributors can manage their pre-Phase-2 content.

**Files reviewed:** migration SQL, `BroadcastingContext.cs`, all 4 domain + EF entity models, `IUserApprovalManager`, `UserApprovalManager`, 6 controllers, `WebMappingProfile.cs`, `ManageRolesViewModel.cs`, `TalkViewModel.cs`, both Admin views, all 6 controller test files.

### 2026-04-02: RBAC Phase 1 — PR #610 Created and Reviewed

**PR:** [#610](https://github.com/jguadagno/jjgnet-broadcast/pull/610) — `feat: RBAC Phase 1 - User Approval & Role-Based Access Control`
**Branch:** `squad/rbac-phase1` → `main`
**Closes:** #602, #603, #604, #605, #606

**What was delivered (46 files, 3,646 insertions):**
- DB migration: `ApplicationUsers`, `Roles`, `UserRoles`, `UserApprovalLog` tables + 3 role seeds
- Domain: models, enums, constants, interfaces for the full approval workflow
- Data.Sql: EF Core repositories + `RbacProfile` AutoMapper mappings
- Managers: `UserApprovalManager` with approve/reject/role-assign audit trail
- Web Auth Pipeline: `EntraClaimsTransformation` (IClaimsTransformation) + `UserApprovalMiddleware`
- Web UI: `AccountController`, `AdminController`, 3 views, 3 ViewModels
- Tests: 37 new tests (5 classes); 631 total passing, 0 failing

**Round 1 Review Verdict: ⚠️ CHANGES REQUESTED**

Review posted as comment (GitHub blocks self-review): https://github.com/jguadagno/jjgnet-broadcast/pull/610#issuecomment-4174117340

**Blocking findings:**

| # | Severity | File | Issue |
|---|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 HIGH | `Program.cs` | `UseUserApprovalGate()` placed AFTER `UseAuthorization` — pending users hit 403 before approval gate fires. Fix: move gate before `UseAuthorization`. |
| 2 | 🟠 MEDIUM | `AdminController.cs` | `GetAllUsersAsync()` loads all users into memory, then filters in C# — violates DB-layer filtering convention. Fix: add `GetUsersByStatusAsync` to manager/data store. |
| 3 | 🟠 MEDIUM | `EntraClaimsTransformation.cs` | Takes `IRoleDataStore` directly — Web layer calling Data layer, bypassing Managers. Fix: expose `GetRolesForUserAsync` on `IUserApprovalManager`. |

**Non-blocking findings:**
- Dead code: `approval_notes` claim read in `AccountController.Rejected()` but never populated by `EntraClaimsTransformation`
- `EntraObjectIdClaimType` constant duplicated in 2 files — should be in `Domain/Constants/`

**Scribe tasks completed:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/` (8 files) merged into `decisions.md`, committed.

### 2026-04-02: RBAC Phase 1 — PR #610 Round 2 Re-Review

**Commits reviewed (in order):**
- `22ad9a7` — Trinity: all 5 Round 1 findings fixed
- `06fbb77` — Tank: updated RBAC tests (GetUserRolesAsync, approval_notes claim, DB-level filtering mock)
- `c77d9d3` — Morpheus: base schema scripts updated (table-create.sql, data-create.sql)
- `56ab6be` — Tank: history update
- `5f3eeb3` — Trinity: BroadcastingContext DI fix in Web Program.cs

**Test results:** 84/84 Web tests pass, 76/76 Managers tests pass (0 failures)

**All 5 Round 1 findings verified resolved:**

| # | Finding | Verified |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | `UseUserApprovalGate()` before `UseAuthorization()` | ✅ Program.cs lines 149–150 |
| 2 | `AdminController.Users()` uses `GetUsersByStatusAsync()` | ✅ 3 DB-level calls |
| 3 | `EntraClaimsTransformation` uses `IUserApprovalManager` only | ✅ `GetUserRolesAsync()` |
| 4 | `approval_notes` claim populated for rejected users | ✅ Lines 63–67 |
| 5 | `ApplicationClaimTypes` constants in Domain | ✅ Partial — middleware missed |

**New additions verified:**
- `table-create.sql` RBAC tables ✅
- `data-create.sql` 3 role seeds ✅
- `BroadcastingContext` DI in Web Program.cs line 61 ✅

**Round 2 Review Verdict: ⚠️ CHANGES REQUESTED**

Review posted: https://github.com/jguadagno/jjgnet-broadcast/pull/610#issuecomment-4174225355

| # | Severity | File | Issue |
|---|----------|------|-------|
| NEW 1 | 🟠 MEDIUM (BLOCKING) | `UserApprovalMiddleware.cs` line 11 | Local `"approval_status"` const — not updated when finding #5 was fixed. Latent gate-bypass bug if `ApplicationClaimTypes.ApprovalStatus` changes. Fix: use `ApplicationClaimTypes.ApprovalStatus`. |
| NEW 2 | 🟡 Low (non-blocking) | Test files (3) | Hardcoded claim strings instead of `ApplicationClaimTypes` constants |
| NEW 3 | 🟡 Low (non-blocking) | `table-create.sql` + migration | Missing SQL CHECK constraints on `ApprovalStatus` and `Action` columns |

**Approved once NEW #1 is fixed. Ready for @jguadagno review and merge.**

### 2026-04-02: RBAC Phase 1 — PR #610 Round 3 Final Sign-off

**Head commit reviewed:** `d0aa61a` (Trinity: all 3 Round 2 findings fixed)

**Round 2 findings — all verified resolved:**

| # | Finding | Verified |
|---|---------|---------|
| NEW 1 (BLOCKING) | `UserApprovalMiddleware.cs` — `ApplicationClaimTypes.ApprovalStatus` used (line 49), local const gone | ✅ |
| NEW 2 (non-blocking) | Test files — `ApplicationClaimTypes.*` constants throughout (0 hardcoded strings) | ✅ |
| NEW 3 (non-blocking) | `table-create.sql` lines 196, 235 + migration lines 94–113 — idempotent CHECK constraints | ✅ |

**Sanity pass — clean:**
- Middleware order: `UseAuthentication` → `UseUserApprovalGate` → `UseAuthorization` ✅
- `EntraClaimsTransformation`: IUserApprovalManager only, ApprovalNotes populated for rejected users ✅
- `UserApprovalManager`: all 8 ops, full arg validation, audit trail ✅
- `AdminController`: `[Authorize(Policy="RequireAdministrator")]`, `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`, DB-level filtering ✅
- `ApplicationClaimTypes.cs`: single source of truth ✅

**New non-blocking observation (Phase 2):**
- `RejectUserViewModel.cs` is dead code — `AdminController.RejectUser()` binds to plain parameters, not to the ViewModel. Validation still correct via server-side null guard + HTML `required` attr. No security impact.

**Round 3 Verdict: ✅ APPROVED**

### Prior Work Archive (Sprint 11 + Early Reviews)

- **Sprint 11 closeout (PRs #551–#555):** 5 PRs merged, later **reverted** (PR #572, MSAL auth broken). Issue #85 open.
- **PR #557 ✅ APPROVED:** CI deployment approval gate + staging slot stop. Non-blocking: step ordering in API/Web (stop should precede get-URL step). Functions workflow had correct order.
- **PR #559 ✅ APPROVED:** Twitter integration tests — all 11 scope items verified. Joseph merged, issue #558 closed.

## Learnings

### 2026-04-05: Issue #639 — EF Core bool/HasDefaultValueSql Warning

- **Key finding:** `BroadcastingContext.cs` configures `ScheduledItem.MessageSent` with `.HasDefaultValueSql("0")`. EF Core 8+ warns on non-nullable `bool` + DB default because it cannot distinguish explicit `false` from CLR default `false`.
- **Fix:** Remove `.HasDefaultValueSql("0")` from the `MessageSent` property configuration — it is redundant since EF Core always inserts the explicit C# value for all mapped properties. No behavioural regression.
- **Pattern:** When a `bool` property has a DB default of `0`/`false`, the `.HasDefaultValueSql()` call is redundant and should be omitted to silence EF Core sentinel warnings.
- **Assigned:** Trinity (EF Core data layer). XS effort.
- **Key files:** `src/JosephGuadagno.Broadcasting.Data.Sql/BroadcastingContext.cs`, `src/JosephGuadagno.Broadcasting.Data.Sql/Models/ScheduledItem.cs`
